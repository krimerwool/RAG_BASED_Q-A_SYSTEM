It all starts with the cacao tree, a species thriving in the humid, equatorial regions of the world. Once the vibrant red or yellow pods ripen, they are harvested and split open to reveal the precious cacao beans, enveloped in a sweet, pulpy covering.   These beans undergo a complex fermentation process, where microorganisms break down the pulp, developing the rich flavors that will define the chocolate. Following fermentation, the beans are dried, often in the sun, until they reach a desired moisture level.
